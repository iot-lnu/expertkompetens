**IMPORTANT**

## Hardware

In order to be able to participate in the course you need to buy **hardware**. The course is based upon MicroPython, and we have chosen to work with Pycom's hardware. There is a possibility to flash MicroPython on other boards as well, but that will not be covered in the course. Also, Pycom has a good PyMakr plugin for both Atom.io and VSCode.

We are happy to announce that [Electrokit](https://www.electrokit.com/) has agreed on setting up a couple of pre-assembled kits for the course, these kits will include both Pycom devices and sensors. The following are the kits that we recommend for this course. Depending on your needs you may choose sensors only bundle, LoPy4 basic bundle, or LoPy4 + sensors bundle.

* [LNU – 1DT305 Tillämpad IoT – Sensors only bundle](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/lnu-1dt305-tillampad-iot-sensors-only-bundle/)
* [LNU – 1DT305 Tillämpad IoT – LoPy4 Basic bundle](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/lnu-1dt305-tillampad-iot-lopy4-basic-bundle/)
* [LNU – 1DT305 Tillämpad IoT – LoPy4 and sensors bundle](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/lnu-1dt305-tillampad-iot-lopy4-and-sensors-bundle/)

* It's also recommended with a battery if you want to power your device away from the computer. The expansion board has a built in LiPo charger, but if you want to use non-rechargeable batteries buy a holder with a switch. **Important make sure the connector is JST-PA or JST-PH, 2 mm**

Wiki: [JST connectors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/JST_connector)

  * [Batterihållare AAA](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/batterihallare-3xaaa-med-strombrytare-och-jst-kontakt/)

  The expansion board has a built in LiPo-charger, so the best is to buy a LiPo-battery with JST-connection:
  * [LiPy battery JST](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/batteri-lipo-3-7v-4400mah/)


We also recommend buying a **sensor-kit**, as the bundles above are just the bare basics:

* [Electrokit, sensor-kit 26 moduler](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/sensor-kit-26-moduler/)

or from:

* [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/Elegoo-aufger%C3%BCsteter-Sensormodul-Bausatz-Anleitung/dp/B01M30ZWQR/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=sensor+kit+arduino&qid=1583957059&sr=8-5)
* [Kjell.com](https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/el-verktyg/arduino/moduler/playknowlogy-stora-modul-paketet-for-arduino-p87291)


## Recommended hardware - MicroPython boards

### Pycom devices:

- [LoPy4 (With headers)](https://pycom.io/product/lopy4/)*
* [Expansion board 3.0](https://pycom.io/product/expansion-board-3-0/)
* [LoRa/SigFox antenna](https://pycom.io/product/lora-868mhz-915mhz-sigfox-antenna-kit/)

**can also be [FiPy](https://pycom.io/product/fipy/) if you want to make use of LTE/NB-IoT*

* Micro USB cable (you probably already have some lying around). Make sure it's of high quality and can transfer data.

### You will also need sensors:

You can choose from a variety of sensors depending on what you want to develop in the course. If you are unsure, please pick just a start kit for Arduino (3.3V).

- Sensors of your choice. I recommend a starting kit from either [amazon.de](https://www.amazon.de/Elegoo-aufger%C3%BCsteter-Sensormodul-Bausatz-Anleitung/dp/B01M30ZWQR/ref=sr_1_5?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=sensor+kit+arduino&qid=1583957059&sr=8-5) for ~30 EUR, or from Swedish distributor [Kjell.com](https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/el-verktyg/arduino/moduler/playknowlogy-stora-modul-paketet-for-arduino-p87291) or
[Electrokit](https://www.electrokit.com/produkt/sensor-kit-26-moduler/)

Wiring and breadboards:

- [Starting kit for Arduino Kjell.com](https://www.kjell.com/se/produkter/el-verktyg/arduino/arduino-kit/luxorparts-basic-start-kit-for-arduino-p90632) or [breadboard(s) from Amazon](https://www.amazon.de/Elegoo-Breadboard-Solderless-Distribution-Verbindungsbl%C3%B6cke/dp/B01MCRZFE5/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&crid=3L86WOJGVV8CB&keywords=breadboard&qid=1583957299&sprefix=breadboard%2Caps%2C282&sr=8-3) and [Dupont cables](https://www.amazon.de/Female-Female-Male-Female-Male-Male-Steckbr%C3%BCcken-Drahtbr%C3%BCcken-bunt/dp/B01EV70C78/ref=sr_1_3?__mk_de_DE=%C3%85M%C3%85%C5%BD%C3%95%C3%91&keywords=dupont+cable&qid=1584042669&sr=8-3).


# Pycom.io

You can buy these directly from Pycom.io, but it's recommended to buy from a Swedish distributor in first hand as the shipping might be both cheaper and faster.

* [LoPy4 (With headers)](https://pycom.io/product/lopy4/)
* [Expansion board 3.0](https://pycom.io/product/expansion-board-3-0/)
* [LoRa/SigFox antenna](https://pycom.io/product/lora-868mhz-915mhz-sigfox-antenna-kit/)

### Choice of LTE and NB-IoT

If you want cellular connection/LTE as well, the **FiPy4** is the way to go (in that case, replace **LoPy4 with FiPy**). It's a bit more expensive, but does the same thing as LoPy4 with added benefit of LTE/NB IoT as well.

- [FiPy](https://pycom.io/product/fipy/)
- [Expansion board 3.0](https://pycom.io/product/expansion-board-3-0/)
- [LTE antenna](https://pycom.io/product/lte-m-antenna-kit/),
- [LoRa/SigFox antenna](https://pycom.io/product/lora-868mhz-915mhz-sigfox-antenna-kit/),
