## Workshops

There will be two types of workshops. One workshop that is planned online and using our Discord server. These basic workshops will be aimed for getting you started with the hardware, and more a basic way to get some hands-on help getting started. They can also be used as a way to actually meet your peers.

The other workshop will be a physical workshop when we all meet together. During both the physical workshops we will spend some time on showcasing our own projects and helping each other. We will also have an opportunity to visit the labs in both Växjö and Kalmar, and during that time also use 3D-printers or any kind of soldering or measuring equipment that is needed for your project. Note that we also have an extensive portfolio of sensors and different kinds of IoT-hardware in our labs, which also might act as a help for your project. In short - the physical workshops are seen as the place where we actually get to meet each other and learn more.

### Online workshops.
- Workshops will be held online on the Discord-server, every week with the exception of the first and last week of the course.

    - Tuesday 17.00-18.00. Online workshop. Christoffer Eid. Discord.
    - Thursday 17.00-18.00. Online workshop. Christoffer Eid. Discord.

- Christoffer Eid (TA) is responsible for the basic workshops.

### Physical workshops
We are having two physical workshops. Both in Kalmar and Växjö. The optimal scenario would be if we could all meet at the second workshop in one place. The workshops are planned as an obligatory session, so please plan to attend.

  - Workshop 1: Wednesday 6/10. 14-17. Växjö and/or Kalmar.
  - Workshop 2: Wednesday 27/10. 14-17. Växjö or Kalmar.
