## Presentation sessions and workshops

Workshops are held in our Dicord server. These basic workshops will be aimed for getting you started with the hardware, and more a basic way to get some hands-on help getting started. They can also be used as a way to actually meet your peers.

The other serssion will be a presentation seminar when we all meet together. During the presentation seminars we will spend some time on showcasing our own projects and helping each other. 

There is also an opportunity to visit the labs in both Växjö and Kalmar, and during that time also use 3D-printers or any kind of soldering or measuring equipment that is needed for your project. We do have a PCB-printer i Kalmar. Note that we also have an extensive portfolio of sensors and different kinds of IoT-hardware in our labs, which also might act as a help for your project.

### Online workshops

Workshops will be held online on the Discord-server, every week.

    - Tuesday TBD Online workshop. Discord.
    - Thursday TBD. Online workshop. Discord.
