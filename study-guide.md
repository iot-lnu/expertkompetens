## Expectations

- Read this document **carefully**. Please give us feedback directly if anything is unclear.
- Plan your studies. Add time to your calendar to view/listen to recorded material. Please be active on all live sessions.
- **Ask questions. Ask questions. Ask questions.** Really - you are always encouraged to ask questions, rather twice than none.
- **Answer questions. Answer questions. Answer question.** We want YOU to be active. Answer all questions, don't wait for someone else. Participation is encouraged.
- **Interact with students and teachers at Discord**. Ask, and do not be afraid to answer questions from other students. Remember - be nice and respectful. The success of the course is based upon your participation.
- Above all, the most important thing - try to adopt a **positive attitude** and **have fun.**

## Objective

The aim of the course is for you to build a connected sensor unit that provides a measured value that is presented over the internet. In the first instance, technology specific to battery-efficient IoT devices will be covered. The course is an ** introductory course **. It is about your own learning and interest, you will thus have a great opportunity to manage your project according to your own wishes.

The course has a practical focus and examination, which means that an IoT unit with sensors is required to be able to be examined. Material recommended according to [Bill of Material](https://coursepress.lnu.se/courses/applied-iot/02-BOM) which should be procured before the start of the course. You can use other devices, if you are unsure, please ask in . The course material will be presented primarily on [Course homepage](https://coursepress.lnu.se/courses/applied-iot/) and some code repository on [Github](https://github.com/iot-lnu/applied-iot-20).

## Communication strategy

- Try to have only, *personal* questions regarding formal participation in the course, absence, grades are sent via email to the course coordinator [Fredrik Ahlgren](fredrik.ahlgren@lnu.se). Please help to maintain the e-mails to a minimum.
- Please post all questions in a public channel at the Discord server. This is because we want to minimize the amount of direct messages (DM:s).
- Questions about the course, assignments, examination, schedule, are asked at **Discord**.
- Information regarding the course will be posted in the ``course-announcements`` channel in the Discord server **It is _important_ that you read everything that is `Pinned`.**
- Respond to **all** `Pinned posts` on Discord.
- You can filter all *`Pinned posts`* according to the figure below.

If you aim for a higher grade than C, you need to present and discuss your project with a Teaching Assistant, no later than three weeks after the course starts. If you haven't done this we cannot guarantee a higher grade, as we need to plan for presentations.

In order to get a higher grade you need to do an individual report/tutorial on **T2**. You are required to make your tutorial public with link shared, we are using hackmd.io for this.

Profile projects, grade A-B, will have the opportunity to be show cased as [good examples](https://hackmd.io/@lnu-iot/good-examples)

The template is found here: [Tutorial template](https://hackmd.io/@lnu-iot/iot-tutorial)

**In order to get a grade >=C you need to do all tasks before deadlines**


## Planning

All planning is found here: 

The course is ten weeks long. The first week is more of an introductory week, getting started with the concepts. All lectures and workshops are planned to evenings (CET) between Monday and Thursday. Exceptions are the weekly video blogs which will be held at Fridays.

All recordings will be published at our Youtube channel, please subscribe and follow the playlist.
