# Getting started with Pycom hardware

Guides are adapted from the Pycom website. https://docs.pycom.io/gettingstarted/ . Make sure you first use the official documentation rather than this tutorial.

- Step 1: Setting up the hardware
- Step 2: Setting up your computer
- Step 3: Programming your module


## General recommendations

Some general pointers before you are getting started.

### FW

Use Pybytes FW. Not legacy.

#### IDE

The recommendation is to use [Atom.io](https://atom.io/) as it generally seems to work better with the PyMakr-plugin. Though, it should not be a problem to stick with [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) for most cases, try and see what works best for you. Both editors are free and work much in the same way, so it's much about personal preference.

#### NodeJS

Make sure you have installed [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/), as there are some dependencies for the PyMakr-plugin which requires NodeJS.

#### Computer setup, known problems

Experience is that it should work well with either Mac, Windows or Linux as the hardware and operating systems. If you are running an old version of Windows some additional drivers are sometimes needed. If you are running Linux, make sure you have the right priviligies to access the USB-ports.
