- What to think of when choosing a project.
  - Start easy.
  - Explore different options.
    - Hardware.

      - OpenMV Cam. ~70 EUR
    - Sensors. Q: Reliability.
    - Communication.
    - Q: Interference between sensor MCU, communication
    - Q: Why certain HW works and not.
    - We have an Otii Energy meter. (IoT) in Kalmar.
  - Emphasis on learning to dive into the design choices. Not building a product.
- The expected complexity of a project in this course.
- Reading material, how to find relevant information. Primer on scientific databases.
  - Science Direct

## Q&A 1st October 16.00-16.30

- Feedback from lectures
  - Hemant, IoT layers
  - Lars Håkansson, sensors (swedish)
- Next workshop. Physical in Växjö Videum science park. 14.00 - 17.00
  - First hour 14-15 will be hybrid. You are all required to present your project ideas.

Where to find us in Växjö: Videum Science Park. Silvia and Hatem will be meeting you.

Where to find us in Kalmar: Kalmar Campus, House Magna floor 4. We'll meet in the IoT-lab (when you're here, it will be obvious where it is, just get to the forth floor and go as far west you can).
